# Ocean Cleanup Game
This is the final project for CISC108 Honors.

**Game Concept**: 
>To clean the ocean by using the trash can and collecting different types of trash on the screen.

**About**: 
>This game was created using the python library, arcade. The objective of the game is to collect all of the trash on the
> screen with the trash can. When you first play the game, it takes you to an intro page. When you click that page, it 
>takes you to an instructions page. After reading the instructions, you click the screen, which then takes you to the 
>game screen. You use your mouse to collect all of the trash. Once all of the trash is collected, the game over screen 
>comes up. You can either play again by clicking the screen or you can exit the game by clicking the window 'x'. This 
>game is symbolic, in the sense that the ocean is filled with trash. Those trash items include soda cans, straws, bags, 
>water bottles, chemicals, etc. All of those items are in the game as the trash you can clean up. The message of the 
>game is to bring awareness to cleaning our oceans. By using the concepts learned in CISC108 and the python arcade, I 
>was able to create a game that allows one to clean up the ocean from their computer.
